## Reporting Bugs or Questions

If you have a question related a current implementation or a desire to implement one, you can submmit a [new issue](https://github.com/gonzalonm/xamarin-forms-clean/issues/new) with a `question` label.
If you have a weird behaviour, please take a moment to recopile all relevant information and then create a [new issue](https://github.com/gonzalonm/xamarin-forms-clean/issues/new).


## Implement new feature

Also, we have a [backlog](https://github.com/gonzalonm/xamarin-forms-clean/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) with features to implement.
In that way, you can submit a new feature to implement if you want. After submission, you must follow these instructions:

- Make a fork: Have you ever created a fork? No? Well, you can read [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
- Create a new local branch (separated from `master`)
- Implement the feature
- Push all changes to a new branch on your forked repo
- Create a new pull request against `master` branch on `xamarin-forms-clean` repo
- The new feature will be reviewed by administrators and then they will give a feedback (merge them or make some changes).
